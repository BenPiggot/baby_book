#About Woolli

##Overview
Woolli is an web application that allows you to commemorate your baby's progress between birth and the age of 5. Woolli has two main features: allows you to create a timeline to which you can add events and upload photos. It also allows you to measure your baby as they grow, charting their progress against national averages.
